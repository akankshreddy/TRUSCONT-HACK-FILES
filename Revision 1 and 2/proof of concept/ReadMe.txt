The Idea
-----------------

When attempting to crack into HexaLock, I saw a list of proggies.  This list is one that HexaLock will inject itself to allow seamless decryption of files if need be. Most API like read and write are hooked within the application so you cant get off there ;(  But that's not a show stopper for us because we are going to use a second program to pull the data out and save it from here.  Nice try guys, but inhouse encryption, API hooking, and code injection isn't gonna save anything here.  So here is one of many proof of concepts that allow HexaLock to do *ALL* the work for us.

I'm done here, I challenge all of you to find another way to trick HexaLock into working FOR you not against you, and I challenge the best to crack/patch this app.

Full VB6 Source Code included, you'll need winsock controls and common dialog controls registered on the computer of your choice.
